# System Requirements

## macOS

Supported versions: Catalina (10.15) - Sonoma (14.x).

> The implementation of our screen sharing feature makes use of [LiveKit](https://livekit.io). The LiveKit SDK requires macOS Catalina (10.15); consequently, in v0.62.4, we dropped support for earlier macOS versions that we were initially supporting.

## Linux, Windows, and Web

_Not officially supported at this time. See our_ [_Platform Support_](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/5391) _issue._

However, you are welcome to [build Zed from source](developing_zed_building_zed.md) for your platform in the meantime.

> [!WARNING]
> Support for these platforms are still in development and will be buggy. When you find any bugs, please make an issue here.
